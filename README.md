## How these tutorials work
Open the tutorial folder you wish to view. You will need to open the HTML document in a browser. Open dev tools in that browser. For the most part, the javascript document is where you will spend most of your time for that tutorial. You wont be doing any actual coding in these tutorials. Everything is written out and prepared to help you visualize what is happening. When the tutorial tells you to uncomment the code below, uncomment the entire code block beneath it (it may be more than one line of code) and then refresh your browser. After you have run that code, comment that code block unless otherwise instructed.

## Who is this for
These tutorials were made for new students of JavaScript. The tutorials are intended to give the student a clear understanding of several important concepts for using JavaScript efficiently and effectively. The tutorials will go over these concepts step by step so the student can visualize what the code is actually doing and gain understanding of how each concept works.
